# 1D-Gross-Pitaevskii-equation
Numerical solver for ground state and time-evolution of one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation for Bose-Einstein Condensate.

Code allows:
1. Calculation of system ground state for given external trap.
2. Time evolution of prepared initial state. Two methods are implemented: 1. Split-step method and 2. Runge-Kutta-45 integrator.
